say There's a place that is magical and full of rain But now it needs help because it is in pain Protecting the earth is a mighty big chore We're spreading awareness like never before! Getting Gay with Kids is here To spread the word, and bring you cheer Lets save the rainforest, whaddaya say? Being an activist is totally gay. Someday if we work hard boys and girls. There will be nothing but rainforests covering the entire world. Getting Gay with Kids is here. To spread the word, and bring you cheer. Getting Gay with Kids is here. Lets save the rainforest, its totally gay. Its totally gay.
